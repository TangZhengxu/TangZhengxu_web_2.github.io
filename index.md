## About Me

Hi! My name is Zhengxu Tang (唐正旭).I am currently a senior at the University of Michigan, pursuing a double major in Mathematical Sciences - Operations Research and Modeling and Computer Science. At present.I'm engaged as a research assistant in the Bio-Medical AI Lab, under the guidance of Dr. Liyue Shen.Previously, I worked in the Li Lab, mentorecby Dr. jinxing Li.
Should you share similar interests or considerpotential collaboration, please feel free to reach out to me at
tangzx@umich.edu.I'd love to engage in discussions and explore
opportunities for collaboration..

## Research Interests

- **AI for Bio-Medical** 
- **Multimodal representation learning** 、
- **AI for Brain-Computer Interface**

My current research focuses on building a multimodal model based on multiple types of medical data, such as medical images, genomics data,EHRs, and so on. I am particularly interested in Multimodal Learning and its applications in the Biomedical field. Human process various modes of information-including sight, sound, smell, and touch-constantly, and this information shapes our cognition and understanding of the world. Everything is interconnected. For this reason, I firmly believe that multimodal deep learning models are the most effective tools for addressing biomedical problems. l am committed to devoting my skills and expertise to this meaningful endeavor, withthe aim of contributing to societal well-being
